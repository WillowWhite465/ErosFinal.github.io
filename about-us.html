        <p>Have you ever wondered where to get quality ice cream in St George? Well we did too, so we did something about it! It all started as a joke with the business's owners friends. It when they would joke the Isaac would be the "ice cream guy" because of all the frozen treats he had in his freezer and slowly but surely he started selling to people growing his business from just a high school side hustle to a growing, original business.</p>
